# why-did-i-block
A simple site to keep notes about the reasons you blocked someone who absolutely doesn't deserve being committed to memory.

### Getting Started

This project provides a `firstrun.sh` script which can be used to get everything ready:
```sh
./scripts/firstrun.sh
```

Alternatively, make sure you have installed
- [`nvm`](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm#git-install)
- the correct `node` version (run `nvm use`)
- [`docker`](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) (see [special instructions](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/windows/wsl/) for developing under WSL)
- [`yarn`](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install/)
